# Codex Repository Instructions

Policy baseline: 2026-08-06

These rules govern Codex/local implementation agents. ChatGPT may finish GitHub-only work without invoking Codex. Route B means ChatGPT edits and Codex verifies/fixes; Route C means Codex implements.

## Authority and handoff

- Follow: latest explicit user instruction; the exact handoff at its referenced ref; closest nested `AGENTS.md`; this file; then other repository docs.
- GitHub files carry the full ChatGPT–Codex instruction and report; chat is only a pointer unless GitHub is unavailable.
- Every Route B/C task must read the named `docs/handoffs/<WORK-ID>-instruction.md`. It defines outcome, scope/non-goals, decisions, targets, checks, Git/PR requirements, and stop conditions.
- If its path/ref is missing or inconsistent, do not rebuild requirements from old chat, stale handoffs, or unrelated branches. Report a BLOCKER.
- Material scope/design changes require an updated handoff/ref. Do not edit the instruction unless asked.

## Efficient execution

- Start with handoff-named files; inspect only applicable rules, code, tests, diffs, and history.
- Do not repeat repo-wide orientation, confirmed decisions, known summaries, or routine prose already supplied by ChatGPT.
- Build the smallest coherent end-to-end outcome. Apply YAGNI; avoid speculative features, broad refactors, parallel systems, and premature abstractions.
- Resolve routine reversible ambiguity with the simplest safe assumption and record it. Escalate only when outcome, authorization, safety, security, financial correctness, or reversibility changes materially.
- Subagents are optional. Use them only for independent parallel work or focused high-risk verification; never use competing writers on overlapping files or duplicate review loops.
- Prefer one run through implementation, checks, in-scope fixes, commit, push, PR update, and report.

## Implementation and checks

- Implement the primary workflow first; add only essential safety/usability. Investigation is not completion unless requested.
- Normal checks: relevant lint/type/syntax, focused tests for changed logic, one happy path, and a runnable smoke test.
- Strengthen checks for destructive work, auth/secrets, migrations, deployment, external writes, security, and financial calculations.
- After fixes, rerun affected checks/smoke only. Never conceal failures or claim unrun checks.
- BLOCKER means primary use fails, material data/security/financial risk remains, required authorization is missing, or safe continuation is impossible. Defer lesser gaps without stopping delivery.

## Git and safety

- Check status, branch, remote, and diff; preserve unrelated work and history. Use the handoff branch or a task branch; stage only in-scope files.
- Do not force-push, rewrite history, merge, release, deploy, delete data, rotate secrets, or operate external systems unless explicitly authorized in the handoff.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, personal/private production data, or machine-specific paths.
- Use repository-specific CI proportionately; do not copy tooling mechanically from another repo.

## Report and completion

- Write the complete result to `docs/handoffs/<WORK-ID>-report.md`; commit/push it with the work and link instruction/report in the PR.
- Report: outcome; changed files; material decisions/assumptions; tests/CI; trial steps; limitations/deferred; simplifications; branch/commit/PR; work time; actual token usage if observable, otherwise `unavailable`; BLOCKER status.
- Chat reply only: Work ID, report path, commit, branch, PR, BLOCKER status. Do not duplicate the report.
- Done when primary use works end to end, critical checks pass, no BLOCKER remains, material risks/recovery are recorded, and GitHub is updated. Check consistency once, then stop.

## Repository-specific rules: Market Desk

- This is a static GitHub Pages dashboard. Preserve direct static hosting and relative asset paths.
- Do not add a server, framework, package manager, or external runtime unless the handoff establishes a current need.
- For UI changes, verify the page loads, core navigation/content remains usable, and browser-console errors are not introduced where a browser check is available.
