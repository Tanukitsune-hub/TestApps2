# Codex Repository Instructions

Policy baseline: 2026-08-11

These rules govern Codex/local implementation agents. ChatGPT may finish GitHub-only work without invoking Codex. Route B means ChatGPT edits and Codex verifies/fixes; Route C means Codex implements.

## Authority and handoff

- Follow: latest explicit user instruction; the exact handoff at its referenced ref; closest nested `AGENTS.md`; this file; then other repository docs.
- GitHub files carry the full ChatGPT–Codex instruction and report; chat is only a pointer unless GitHub is unavailable.
- Every Route B/C task must read the named `docs/handoffs/<WORK-ID>-instruction.md`. It defines outcome, scope/non-goals, decisions, targets, checks, Git/PR requirements, and stop conditions.
- If its path/ref is missing or inconsistent, do not rebuild requirements from old chat, stale handoffs, or unrelated branches. Report a BLOCKER.
- Material scope/design changes require an updated handoff/ref. Do not edit the instruction unless asked.

## Before starting implementation

1. Check `git status`, the current branch, remote, and upstream.
2. Fetch the latest remote changes.
3. Fast-forward pull when it is safe and does not overwrite, stash, commit, or otherwise disturb local work.
4. If local changes, detached HEAD, divergence, missing upstream, or another unsafe condition exists, stop before implementation and explain the state and safest next step.
5. Begin implementation only after the repository state is understood and safely synchronized, or the handoff explicitly authorizes working from the current state.

## Efficient execution

- Start with handoff-named files; inspect only applicable rules, code, tests, diffs, and history.
- Do not repeat repo-wide orientation, confirmed decisions, known summaries, or routine prose already supplied by ChatGPT.
- Build the smallest coherent end-to-end outcome. Apply YAGNI; avoid speculative features, broad refactors, parallel systems, and premature abstractions.
- Resolve routine reversible ambiguity with the simplest safe assumption and record it. Escalate only when outcome, authorization, safety, security, financial correctness, or reversibility changes materially.
- Use subagents selectively but proactively when work can be split into independent, non-overlapping exploration, implementation, or verification tasks. Never use competing writers on overlapping files or duplicate review loops.
- Prefer one run through implementation, checks, in-scope fixes, commit, push, PR update, and report.

## Subagent selection

- Use the standard Codex subagent capabilities available in the current runtime when work can be safely divided into independent, non-overlapping workstreams.
- Prefer parallel subagents for repository exploration, focused implementation support, testing, independent review, and adversarial validation when this materially improves speed or confidence.
- Do not select or invoke repository-defined custom agents unless the user explicitly requests them.
- The main agent remains responsible for the primary outcome, architectural decisions, integration, conflict resolution, and final verification.
- Avoid overlapping edits between subagents unless coordination is explicitly necessary.
- Do not spawn subagents merely to increase activity; use them only when parallelism, independent reasoning, or context separation is useful.

## Implementation and checks

- Implement the primary workflow first; add only essential safety/usability. Investigation is not completion unless requested.
- Normal checks: relevant lint/type/syntax, focused tests for changed logic, one happy path, and a runnable smoke test.
- Strengthen checks for destructive work, auth/secrets, migrations, deployment, external writes, security, and financial calculations.
- After fixes, rerun affected checks/smoke only. Never conceal failures or claim unrun checks.
- BLOCKER means primary use fails, material data/security/financial risk remains, required authorization is missing, or safe continuation is impossible. Defer lesser gaps without stopping delivery.

## Git and safety

- Check status, branch, remote, and diff; preserve unrelated work and history. Use the handoff branch or a task branch; stage only in-scope files.
- Do not force-push, rewrite history, merge, release, deploy, delete data, rotate secrets, or operate external systems unless explicitly authorized in the handoff.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, personal/private production data, or machine-specific paths.
- Use repository-specific CI proportionately; do not copy tooling mechanically from another repo.

## GitHub Actions and CI budget

- Local executable validation is the primary development loop. Keep implementation PRs in Draft while iterating; do not spend GitHub Actions minutes on routine pushes or Draft PR updates.
- Standard CI should run only for the final candidate when the PR is non-Draft / ready for review, and rerun when that ready PR's head changes. Keep manual dispatch for an explicit final rerun, and cancel superseded in-progress runs where supported.
- Historical, attestation, and archival checks should be manual unless the exact task requires them. Post-merge deployment or release workflows may run on `main` when required to deliver the product; they are not development CI. The existing GitHub Pages workflow is such a deployment workflow and may continue to deploy from `main`.
- Exhausted Actions minutes, billing restrictions, GitHub-hosted-runner unavailability, or quota-related startup failures are not BLOCKERs and must not stop implementation. Complete equivalent local validation, commit, push, and update the PR/report. Record GitHub CI or deployment as unavailable or skipped for an external quota reason and do not describe it as a code or test failure.
- A task may be completed with `BLOCKER: NONE` when all required local validation passes and the only missing evidence is GitHub Actions unavailable for quota, billing, or hosted-runner reasons. A deployment may remain pending without invalidating the implementation result.
- Do not repeatedly rerun a job that cannot start because of quota or billing. When Actions becomes available, the final candidate or pending deployment may be validated or delivered then. If repository settings physically prevent merge, report that as an external merge constraint; do not treat the implementation itself as failed or rework unrelated code merely to obtain CI.

## Report and completion

- Write the complete result to `docs/handoffs/<WORK-ID>-report.md`; commit/push it with the work and link instruction/report in the PR.
- Report: outcome; changed files; material decisions/assumptions; tests/CI; trial steps; limitations/deferred; simplifications; branch/commit/PR; BLOCKER status.
- Chat reply only: Work ID, report path, commit, branch, PR, BLOCKER status. Do not duplicate the report.
- Done when primary use works end to end, critical checks pass, no BLOCKER remains, material risks/recovery are recorded, and GitHub is updated. Check consistency once, then stop.

## Repository-specific rules: Market Desk

- This is a static GitHub Pages dashboard. Preserve direct static hosting and relative asset paths.
- Do not add a server, framework, package manager, or external runtime unless the handoff establishes a current need.
- For UI changes, verify the page loads, core navigation/content remains usable, and browser-console errors are not introduced where a browser check is available.
